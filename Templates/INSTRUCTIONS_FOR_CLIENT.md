# The Planning Paradise - Website Content Preparation Guide

Dear Client,

To ensure your website is populated with the best content, please use the attached templates to provide your project details, gallery images, and team information.

### 📁 1. Gallery Content (Gallery_Template.csv)
This is for the general design catalog/gallery where users can browse and inquire about specific setups.
- **Image Filename:** Name of the photo file you are providing (e.g., `stage_decoration_1.jpg`).
- **Category:** Diamond, Gold, or Silver (based on your pricing/tier structure).
- **Design Code:** A unique code for each design (e.g., DIA-001) so clients can refer to it during inquiries.
- **Alt Text:** A brief description for SEO (e.g., "Grand Royal Wedding Stage with Red Roses").
- **Client Count:** (Optional) Number of times this design has been used to show popularity.

### 📁 2. Portfolio/Projects (Portfolio_Template.csv)
This is for showcasing your past successful events with stories and details.
- **Project Title:** The name of the event (e.g., "Sharma Wedding Gala").
- **Description:** 2-3 sentences about the event highlights.
- **Additional Images:** If you have multiple photos for ONE project, list them separated by commas.

## 📷 Photo Guidelines:
1. **Quality:** High-resolution images preferred (Min 1920x1080px).
2. **Format:** .jpg or .png
3. **Naming:** Please name your photo files clearly to match the "Image Filename" column in the Excel sheets (e.g., `wedding-jaipur-1.jpg` instead of `IMG_1234.jpg`).

Once filled, please send these CSV/Excel files back along with a folder containing all the renamed photos.
